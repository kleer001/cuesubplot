Children who ignore what they're told,
If only they would hear and see,

When kids act like they're wild.
Store owners should take note, 
And keep these young ones in their fold.

They make noise and no one does care,
But if they're not kept quiet or contained,
Then they can ruin everyone's dine!

******
Result: Children who throw tantrums,

Makes me want to shout,
"Can't you see the error of your ways?"
